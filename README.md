Wechat server for zh.asoiaf

We moved our wiki site from [wikia](http://zh.asoiaf.wikia.com "wikia") to [huiji](http://asoiaf.huiji.wiki "huiji") in April 2015, thus functionalities of this module breaks on huiji.wiki since it depends on [API](http://zh.asoiaf.wikia.com/api/v1 "Wikia API") provided by Wikia. 

A legacy tag, which is marked as `v1.0.0` is exported for those who wish to do further development for the old wiki site on wikia. However, we strongly recommend anyone who are willing to contribute to try out the new site on huiji.wiki because it provides more useful and interesting features and our feedback will be handled directly by the dev team, whose leader is the exact founder of our wiki site, @Reasno. 

Further development on this module is being planed. Let us see how API of huiji.wiki works.
